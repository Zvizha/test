                <p>
                  Panels are often used in clinical settings because they’re low cost and provide high quality coverage of specific, pre-defined genomic regions of interest. While useful in certain settings, such assays are limited by their narrow focus.

                  With ≥ 99.5% call rate across ~600 genes relevant to many disease states, the Exome+ assay enables you to run multiple panel-grade analyses with a single sample.
